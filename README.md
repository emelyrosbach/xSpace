# README 

Have you ever wondered what standing on a different planet would feel like? This human desire is also the basis for the educational virtual reality application “xSpace”, which allows users to explore different planets and moons in our solar system and uses a gamification approach to educate people about our galaxy and peculiarities of specific planets. The xSpace project was implemented employing the Unity game engine and Oculus headset, allowing for an immersive experience, where users could not only see different planets, but also experience the unique sounds and gravity of each specific planet.
